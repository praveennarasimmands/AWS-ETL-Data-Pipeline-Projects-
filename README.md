## **Description:**
The Weather Data ETL Pipeline automates the process of extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) weather data from the NASA POWER API. The pipeline fetches data for specified locations and date ranges, processes it into a structured format, and uploads it to Amazon S3 for analysis and reporting. It is designed to be scalable, efficient, and easily deployable.

## **Key Learnings:**

  - How to extract weather data using the NASA POWER API.
  - Transforming raw weather data into structured formats for analysis.
  - Automating the process of uploading transformed data to Amazon S3.
  - Implementing logging for traceability and troubleshooting in ETL workflows.
  - Integration of various APIs (Nominatim, NASA POWER) for location and weather data.
